# Bayesian Optimization Package

A lightweight and modular Python package for building Gaussian Process surrogate models and performing Bayesian Optimization on black-box functions. Ideal for optimization tasks where function evaluations are expensive or noisy.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Build and train a Gaussian Process (GP) model using BoTorch
- Define and evaluate black-box functions
- Optimize an acquisition function (UCB) to find promising candidate points
- Visualize the GP model and optimization progress
